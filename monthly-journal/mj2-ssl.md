## SSL

I'm pretty use to SSL, PKI and the like but being new to Python, I need to do a little research. Turns out that getting SSL up and running in Python is a doddle (like most things). Found a great little snippet [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/111/) and a good tutorial [here](http://bobthegnome.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/making-ssl-connection-in-python.html).


I generate a self-signed cert and literally 5 minutes later I had TLS 1.2 AES256 secure communication with Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman no less! Of course it's not 100% secure because it's not CA signed and I did spend consider using LetsEncrypt to get a free CA signed cert but then I figure it was only a nice to have.

Booya!
