The treat of ransom-ware is very much to the forefront of Watson Platform for Health security concerns. Patient Health Information (PHI) is highly valued by cyber criminals and our in-house Ops and Security team are engaged in a continuous cycle of security evaluation and improvement. The threat of malware inside the firewall is almost of grave concern and the potential for PHI loss if very real. We recognised the need for an IDS solution that can detect malware and Trojans and also detect and prevent a ransom-ware attack e.g. [CryptoLocker](#1-httpsenwikipediaorgwikicryptolocker) [1] which typically involves encryption of victim's files.
