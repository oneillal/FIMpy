## Slack
![](../assets/slack.png) Slack is everywhere these days. It's pretty much the defacto collaboration platform now so I plan to send FIMpy alerts to Slack. Should be easy enough to use a web hook at a minimum to fire not a slack channel. I've done this before in bash scripts using curl and I'm assuming (hoping) there are Python libraries for this.

**Update:** Found this Python interface for the Slack: https://github.com/os/slacker Looks perfect for my needs. Looks like I need a Slack developer API key. Need to read up on this.
