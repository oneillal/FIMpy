## Python

I have decided to use Python to develop my solution due to the flexibility of the language and the speed at which results can be achieved. Python also offers a huge array of community supported libraries and functions that I hope to be able to take advantage of. Python also has numerous web frameworks. I am going to utilise the Flask framework for my application using a micro-services approach. Flask is also supported by Bluemix which is where I plan to host my Python application. I have very little practical experience with Python.

**Update:** Python rules!
