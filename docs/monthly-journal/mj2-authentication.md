## Authentication

So turns out that AppID is not what I need. There is an third party IAM service called PAssport but it doesn't fall under the free IBMer Bluemix plan. It has a 14 day trial but that obviously won't work. I really need authentication and I really don't want to write reams of code to implement it.

Looking outside Bluemix, I came across JumpCloud [LDAP-as-a-Service](https://jumpcloud.com/daas-product/ldap-as-a-service). They offers a free plan for max of 5 users so I'll give it a try.
