## The Idea

After toying with a few initial ideas, I talked to our in house security team because I wanted a real world security related problem for my project. After a quick chat, a good idea came about. A file integrity monitoring solution, or FIM. I had to do a little research. Turns out, there are many tools already that do something similar. Tripwire, Aide, Samhain to name a few. Almost all are built in C derivatives for obvious performance reasons. We can't use open-source on a PHI platform so a home-grown solution might be a good fir. The plan is to write an application which addresses our specific uses cases and requirements (which are mainly cloud driven) and develop with a modern programing language and using existing PAAS, libraries and services as much as possible.
