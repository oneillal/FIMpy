## The Idea
After toying with a few initial ideas, I talked to our in house security team because I wanted to a real world security related problem for my project. After a quick chat, a good idea came about. A file integrity monitoring solution, or FIM. I had to do a little research. Turns out, there are many tools already that do something similar. Tripwire, Aide, Samhain to name a few. Almost all built in C derivatives for obvious performance reasons. My descire was to write an application which addresses the specific uses cases and requirements and develop with a modern programing language and using existing PAAS, libraries and services where possible.
